# Sub-Issue Documentation

This directory contains documentation for creating a sub-issue in the **bf56rrxbrs-crypto/agent-ai** repository.

## Purpose

This documentation was created in response to a request to create a sub-issue for [agent-ai#2](https://github.com/bf56rrxbrs-crypto/agent-ai/issues/2) ("Set up Copilot instructions") to automate the setup task.

## Why Documentation Instead of Direct Issue Creation?

In this project context, the automation tools used do not have the necessary GitHub token permissions or repository/organization authorization to create issues via the GitHub API. Instead, this comprehensive documentation provides everything needed to manually create the sub-issue.

## Files Included

### 1. SUB_ISSUE_agent-ai-2.md
**Detailed Technical Specification**

This is the comprehensive document containing:
- Complete problem statement and context
- Detailed objectives and proposed solutions
- Technical architecture and components
- Implementation phases and steps
- Acceptance criteria (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- Testing strategy
- Resource estimates
- Dependencies and blockers

Use this document when you need:
- Complete technical details for implementation
- Understanding of scope and requirements
- Reference material during development
- Basis for project planning and estimation

### 2. SUB_ISSUE_QUICK_CREATE.md
**Quick Reference Guide**

This is the streamlined version containing:
- Copy-paste ready issue title and description
- Condensed key points
- Step-by-step instructions for creating the issue
- Labels and linking guidance

Use this document when you need:
- Quick issue creation in GitHub
- Summary of requirements
- Reference to the full specification

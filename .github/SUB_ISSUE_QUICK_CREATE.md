🤖 Automate Copilot Instructions Setup Process
```

### Body
```markdown
## Parent Issue
Part of bf56rrxbrs-crypto/agent-ai#2

## Description
Create an automation workflow to streamline the setup and maintenance of Copilot instructions across repositories.

## Problem
Currently, setting up Copilot instructions requires manual configuration. This should be automated to:
- Reduce manual effort and human error
- Ensure consistency across repositories  
- Enable easy updates and maintenance
- Provide a reusable solution

## Solution
Create automation that:
1. Analyzes repository structure and technology stack
2. Generates appropriate Copilot instructions from templates
3. Validates instructions against best practices
4. Deploys via GitHub Actions workflow

## Deliverables
- [ ] Setup script for generating instructions
- [ ] GitHub Action workflow for automation
- [ ] Template system for different languages/frameworks
- [ ] Validation tool for instruction quality
- [ ] Documentation for usage and customization

## Technical Components
```
.github/workflows/copilot-instructions-setup.yml
scripts/setup-copilot-instructions.sh
.github/templates/copilot-instructions-template.md
scripts/validate-copilot-instructions.sh
docs/COPILOT_AUTOMATION.md
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Setup script generates valid Copilot instructions
- [ ] GitHub Action runs successfully
- [ ] Generated instructions follow best practices
- [ ] Validation catches common issues
- [ ] Works for Swift/iOS repositories
- [ ] Documentation is complete

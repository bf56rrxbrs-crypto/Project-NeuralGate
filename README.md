## 🚀 Quick Start

```swift
import NeuralGate

// Initialize the agent
let agent = NeuralGate.NeuralGateAgent()

// Process natural language request
Swift.Task {
    let result = try await agent.processRequest("Send a message to John")
    print("Task completed: \(result.success)")
}

// Execute a workflow
Swift.Task {
    let workflow = try await agent.executeWorkflow("morning-routine")
    print("Workflow executed with \(workflow.stepResults.count) steps")
}

// Schedule a task
let task = NeuralGate.Task(
    name: "Send Report",
    description: "Send weekly report to team",
    priority: .high
)
Swift.Task {
    try await agent.scheduleTask(task, for: Date().addingTimeInterval(3600))
}

// Get intelligent suggestions
let suggestions = agent.getTaskSuggestions()

// Analyze platform capabilities (NEW)
Swift.Task {
    let opportunities = await agent.analyzeCapabilities()
    print("Found \(opportunities.count) enhancement opportunities")
}

// Generate feature suggestions (NEW)
Swift.Task {
    let features = await agent.generateFeatureSuggestions()
    print("Generated \(features.count) feature suggestions")
}
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **iOS**: 16.0+
- **Swift**: 5.9+
- **Xcode**: 15.0+
- **Platform**: iPhone only

## 🎯 AI Enhancement Systems

NeuralGate includes four powerful AI enhancement systems for continuous platform improvement:

```swift
// 1. Capability Discovery - Identify platform improvements
Swift.Task {
    let capabilities = await agent.analyzeCapabilities()
    let report = agent.generateCapabilityReport()
    print(report)
}

// 2. Usage Pattern Analysis - Detect patterns and gaps
Swift.Task {
    let patterns = await agent.analyzeUsagePatterns()
    let gaps = await agent.identifyUsageGaps()
    print("Found \(patterns.count) patterns and \(gaps.count) gaps")
}

// 3. Model Recommendation - Select optimal AI models
Swift.Task {
    let recommendation = await agent.recommendModel(for: task, context: context)
    let models = agent.getAvailableModels()
    print("Recommended: \(recommendation.model.name) from \(models.count) available models")
}

// 4. Feature Suggestions - Generate feature roadmap
Swift.Task {
    let suggestions = await agent.generateFeatureSuggestions()
    let roadmap = agent.generateFeatureRoadmap()
    print("Generated \(suggestions.count) feature suggestions")
}
```
